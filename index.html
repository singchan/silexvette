                    <div><font size="2">A&amp;A Corvette Performance started out as a small Corvette performance shop that began modifying existing Corvette supercharger systems in 2001. Early systems were plagued with belt and heating issues. (and some still are) We found ways of rerouting the belts and moving pulleys that helped these belt issues immensely. We also started building the first front mounted single intercooler in the business. Shortly thereafter we started making our own supercharger brackets that alleviated all the belt issues of the day. In late 2002 we marketed the first A&amp;A Supercharger system using our own brackets, intercooler, tubing, and sheet metal parts. Through constant testing and improving, our systems have evolved into the most popular and reliable Corvette supercharger systems available today.</font></div>

                    <div><font size="2">Take the time to read about our many innovations and compare our systems to our competitors HERE (link)&nbsp;<br><br></font></div>
                    <div><font size="2">A&amp;A Superchargers has been the Vortech Factory Authorized Manufacturer of supercharger systems for all models of C5, C6 and, now, C7 Corvette since 2009. Our proprietary head units are manufactured exclusively for A&amp;A by Vortech to our specifications. &nbsp;These units can only be purchased through A&amp;A or one of our nearly 200 dealers in the USA and Europe. The entire system is designed and manufactured by A&amp;A Corvette in Southern California. As of January 2016 A&amp;A had &nbsp;produced over 3000 Corvette supercharger systems for the C5, C6 and C7 Corvette. Of these 3000 plus systems, approximately 20% of them were installed and dyno tuned in our own shop. Approximately 30% were sold to "do it yourselfers" who installed the systems at home. The remainder were installed through our ever-growing network of authorized sales and installation centers.&nbsp;</font></div>
                    <div><font size="2"><br>We are a family owned business and pride ourselves in both the quality of our products and our unrivaled customer service before and after the sale.&nbsp;</font></div>
                    <div><font size="2"><br>We are here to help! Talk to us. While we do have online ordering, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you call us and discuss your expectations and possible goals for the future. Picking the right unit for your application is something that will be best approached with some guidance from us. Try to forget what you read on the internet forums and ask us what we would recommend. More often than not, we will recommend a smaller system than you think you may want. We know what works. Bigger is not necessarily better when it comes to superchargers.</font></div>
                    <div><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></div>
                    <div><font size="2">Even the decision of whether to install the system yourself or have it professionally installed, should be an informed decision. Being able to say you installed the system yourself may give you quite a sense of accomplishment. On the other hand, we’ve seen quite a few enthusiasts who would have been much better off having the system professionally installed. Ask us questions and read over our instruction manual before deciding.&nbsp;</font></div>
                    <div><font size="2">If you have aspirations of “going big” in the future, talk to us about it. We have a lot of experience in big builds and can guide you in the right direction. There are some things that may save you money by buying now, some things that can be put off and some things that are just not going to be needed at all. (reread the comment about the internet forums)&nbsp;</font></div>

                    <div><font size="2">If you have an awesome build, have run a great track time or just want to talk about cars, call us! We love to talk cars!</font></div>
